# fract-ol
This program takes as it's input the kind of fractol the user wishes to see, either julia or mandelbrot set
and renders it in a window. The program uses an external library called mini libx for mac to render images,
pixels, or strings on the window. Julia sets could be drawn using the starting points the user passes as arguments.

When the image is rendered mouse could zoom, clicking on the window would draw a different julia set starting from the
point that was clicked on.
